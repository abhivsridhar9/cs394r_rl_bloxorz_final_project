Because the absolute value loss function $|x|$ has a derivative of -1 for all negative values of x and a derivative of 1 for all positive values of x, clipping the squared error to be between -1 and 1 corresponds to using an absolute value loss function for errors outside of the (-1,1) interval. This form of error clipping further improved the stability of the algorithm."
